% TODO: Take a look at the difference in the model itself
% Observations:
%   - Forward pass: loop over layers on CPU and call kernel that many times, 
%   - Backward pass:
%      - Output: single call to kernel on CPU, 
%      - Hidden: loop over rest of layers on CPU and call kernel that many times, 
%   - Updates: Reduced kernel calling (complicated) for bias & weights, plus update kernels
%   - "Cleanup": copy back of biases and weights
