HYPOTHESIS 1: Speedup is explained by smaller workload per element for thread,
              making it more balanced and therefore faster, as more can be
              done in parallel towards the end. Even though this is a small
              difference, the number of iterations blows this up.

EXPERIMENT A: Prove / disprove this by running with a lot of samples and small
              network nodes per layer, to minimize the size of the parallelized
              region and therefore the effect of this phenomanon
RESULT:       OpenMP 7 is still significantly faster; theory seems disproven

EXPERIMENT B: Try again, this time with no hidden layers and still a reasonable
              node size for the input layer
