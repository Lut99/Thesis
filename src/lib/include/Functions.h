/***** COST FUNCTIONS *****/

/* Implements the Mean Squared Error as cost function. Both matrices should be vectors of the same length, and if they aren't, a negative double (-1) is returned and an error to stderr is printed. Note that for efficiency, the first matrix is used as buffer for the in-between values and will be overwritten. */

/***** COST FUNCTIONS (PARTIAL) DERIVATIVES *****/

/* Implements the partial derivative of some other cost function that returns the change in weights for given deltas of the next layer and given outputs of this layer. */
