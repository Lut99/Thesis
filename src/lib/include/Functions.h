/* Implements the simplest of activation functions: f(x) = x. */

/* Implements the softmax function working on an entire matrix. Note that this operation is performed in-place. */

/* Implements the derivative of the sigmoid function working on an entire matrix. Note that this operation is performed in-place. */

/***** COST FUNCTIONS *****/

/* Implements the Mean Squared Error as cost function. Both matrices should be vectors of the same length, and if they aren't, a negative double (-1) is returned and an error to stderr is printed. */

/* Implements some other cost function as cost function. Both matrices should be vectors of the same length, and if they aren't, a negative double (-1) is returned and an error to stderr is printed. */

/***** COST FUNCTIONS (PARTIAL) DERIVATIVES *****/

/* Implements the partial derivative of some other cost function that returns the change in weights for given deltas of the next layer and given outputs of this layer. */
matrix* dydx_other_cost_func(const matrix* deltas, const matrix* output);
