/***** ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS *****/

/* Implements the sigmoid function working on an entire matrix. Note that this operation is performed in-place. */

/***** ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS DERIVATIVES *****/

/* Implements the derivative of the sigmoid function working on an entire matrix. Note that this operation is performed in-place. */

/***** COST FUNCTIONS *****/

/* Implements the Mean Squared Error as cost function. Both matrices should be vectors of the same length, and if they aren't, a negative double (-1) is returned and an error to stderr is printed. Note that for efficiency, the first matrix is used as buffer for the in-between values and will be overwritten. */
