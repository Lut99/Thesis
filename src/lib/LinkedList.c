 * Description:
 *   This file implements a LinkedList datastructure to quickly add
 *   elements. Note that the elements should be pointers, which can
 *   optionally be deallocated as well upon destruction. Additionally, this
 *   library also supports the convertion of LinkedLists to newly allocated
 *   arrays with pointers to the same values.
